# COVID19-Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detector
In the troubling times like these ,  we need a tool that keep us safe from the deadly virus.
This projects detects in realtime wether a person is wearing a mask or not .
It is made using the **Convulation Neural networks(CNN)** and is trained on 2 CNN layers and runs on an accuracy of over 95%.
The real time is implimented using **openCV** and facial categorization using "haarclasscadeclassifier".
The model was trained on a dataset , consisting of over 1500 images which was a combined collection of both masked and non-masked images.
It is quite useful, especially in these tough times , where wearing a mask is a compulsion, this model can be used for security purposes , assesing purposes, used by the cops and government organisation to seggregate the people not wearing masks, if implimented in public areas.
